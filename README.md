Dear fellow coders,

I am excited to share with you a new project that I have been working on. It is a GitHub repository where we can practice and improve our data structures and algorithms skills by solving the problem of the day (POTD) from GeeksforGeeks (gfg).

In this repo, you will find detailed explanations for each POTD, along with the code in different programming languages. You will also be able to compare your solutions with others and learn from their feedback.

The goal of this project is to help each other grow as programmers and prepare for coding interviews. I hope you will join me in this journey and contribute to the repo with your own solutions and comments.

To get started, please visit the link below and follow the instructions on how to clone the repo and submit your solutions.

Thank you for your interest and support. Let's learn and grow together!
